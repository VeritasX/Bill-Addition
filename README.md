  What is this app?
 
 This App is simple bill calculator that adds up your total cost of your bills for you as you enter them and lists your bills and there      cost in the order you entered them in.
 This was my first Angular 2+ project.
 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
